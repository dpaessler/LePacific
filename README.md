RIAA MM JFET Phono Preamplifier based on the design found here:

An additional EAGLE library is used for the JFET, which can be found here:

The coupling capacitors have to be added separately, they don't fit on the board. I used a matched pair
of NOS russian military 2.2uF 250V PIO capacitors K75-10.
